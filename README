Assignment 9

This program displays the bezier patch and bounded bunny model for assignment 9.

For part 1: 
make run-p1 - will run the first part

Keys: 
Arrow keys - Navigate between control points
q - Increase x-value of control point
a - Decrease x-value of control point
w - Increase y-value of control point
s - Decrease y-value of control point
e - Increase z-value of control point
d - Decrease z-value of control point
y - Increase camera height
h - Decrease camera height
u - Increase camera radius
j - Decrease camera radius
i - Increase rotation around the y-axis
k - Decrease rotation around the y-axis
o - Increase resolution by 1 (Max 20)
l - Decrease resolution by 1 (Min 1)
esc - Quit application
Mouse: 
Right click to access the materials
Light Positions: 
There is one light at the position of the camera with diffuse (0.5, 0.5, 0.5) ambient (0.2, 0.2, 0.2) specular (0.5, 0.5, 0.5)
Materials: 
Pink Material: Diffuse (1.0, 0.8, 0.0) Ambient (1.0, 0.0, 1.0) Specular (1.0, 0.0, 1.0) Shininess 5.0 
Blue Latex Material: Diffuse (0.0, 0.8, 0.0) Ambient (0.0, 0.0, 0.5) Specular (0.0, 0.0, 1.0) Shininess 50.0 
Stone Material: Diffuse (0.2, 0.2, 0.2) Ambient (0.5, 0.5, 0.5) Specular (0.8, 0.8, 0.8) Shininess 10.0 
NOTE: The bezier patch should have a checkerboard pattern applied to it. 
NOTE: press escape to quit, killing the process will make the makefile not run part 2. 

For part 2:
make run-p2 - will run the second part

Keys: 
q - Increase camera height
a - Decrease camera height
w - Increase camera radius
s - Decrease camera radius
e - Increase camera speed
d - Decrease camera speed
r - Increase light height
f - Decrease light height
t - Increase light radius
g - Decrease light radius
y - Increase light speed
h - Decrease light speed
Mouse: 
Right click to access the projection, camera start/stop menu, materials, and shading menus
Light Positions: 
Static Light 1: At ( 0.0, 2.0, 0.0) diffuse (0.5, 0.5, 0.5) ambient (0.2, 0.2, 0.2) specular (0.5, 0.5, 0.5)
Static Light 2: At ( 0.0, -2.0, 0.0) diffuse (0.5, 0.5, 0.5) ambient (0.2, 0.2, 0.2) specular (0.5, 0.5, 0.5)
Dynamic Light: Starts At ( 0.0, 0.0, 2.0) Rotates At Start At 0.1f diffuse (0.5, 0.5, 0.5) ambient (0.2, 0.2, 0.2) specular (0.5, 0.5, 0.5)
Materials: 
White Material: Diffuse (1.0, 1.0, 1.0) Ambient (1.0, 1.0, 1.0) Specular (1.0, 1.0, 1.0) Shininess 5.0 
Blue Latex Material: Diffuse (0.0, 0.8, 0.0) Ambient (0.0, 0.0, 0.5) Specular (0.0, 0.0, 1.0) Shininess 50.0 
Stone Material: Diffuse (0.2, 0.2, 0.2) Ambient (0.5, 0.5, 0.5) Specular (0.8, 0.8, 0.8) Shininess 10.0 
Note: The bunny should be textured with a cloud-like pattern. You can change the material but the cloud 
pattern looks best on the pure white material.

To develop this program I using a native install of ubuntu 12.04 on my laptop.
My laptop has an NVidia 580m GPU which supports OpenGL version 4.3.

The compiler I used is:
g++ (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.6.3-1ubuntu5) 4.6.3
